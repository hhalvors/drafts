Metaphysics first, or mathematics first? The simple answer is
\emph{neither}. But I should explain.

The question in front of us has implications for many different
things. I, however, am mostly concerned with coming to terms with the
foundations of quantum mechanics. I am \emph{still} hung up on the
question of what quantum physics means for us (i.e.\ what
philosophical lessons it offers), and I'll take any help I can get.

There are two groups of philosophers who are prepared to offer me
help. Each group has a core doctrine; and interestingly enough, these
doctrines share a common syntactic form: ``m\dots\ first''. One group
says ``metaphysics first'' and the other group says ``mathematics
first''. Each group offers convincing motivations for its doctrine;
and each doctrine picks out a unique acceptable understanding of the
lesson of quantum physics.\footnote{I must qualify. While
  ``metaphysics first'' is usually thought to lead uniquely to Bohmian
  mechanics, there are recent arguments to the effect that
  ``metaphysics first'' might rather lead to wavefunction realism.} It
behooves us, then, to ask whether we are willing to adopt one of these
``m\dots\ first'' ideologies.

\section{Mathematics first}

It's an easier task to describe the ``mathematics first'' ideology, as
that has already been done quite clearly by David Wallace. In fact,
Wallace's paper has the subtitle ``mathematics-first approaches to
physics and metaphysics'' and he indicates clearly that he believes
this to be the right approach. If one knows Wallace's other work, and
its beautiful systematicity, one will also become convinced that the
mathematics-first approach leads uniquely to the Everett
interpretation of quantum mechanics.

\section{Metaphysics first}

%% Devitt

%% Fichte 

Ok, let me come clean that no philosopher of physics has literally
said ``metaphysics first,'' at least not that I know of. For me to say
that they subscribe to the metaphysics first doctrine is a bit of an
extrapolation. Nonetheless, I am confident that the case can be made
that the invocation of metaphysics first is precisely what lies behind
the arguments for Bohmian mechanics.
